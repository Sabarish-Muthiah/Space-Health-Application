# Space-Health-Application
Hello! This program is a basic and simple project of a Space Health Application. Our weight differs significantly from each planet due to the differences in gravity and atmospheric pressure. This application is designed to test the weight of the user on different planets. First it asks to input he user's weight. Then the program outputs the different lists of planets in our Milky Way Galaxy. Next, this program asks the user to choose a planet and input the planet's code number as seen in the list. After the user inputs the code number of a chosen planet, the weight of that user in that particular planet will get outputted. In this program, I have used the common concepts of Cout, Cin, Switch, Case, Break etc. Thanks for viewing this program.
